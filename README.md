# SÃ©rgio Santos | Front-End Engineer

This site is built using my personal [Grunt development workflow](https://github.com/s3rgiosan/grunt-workflow).  
For the CSS I'm using LESS with BEM (block, element, identifier) syntax, a front-end naming methodology thought up by the guys at [Yandex](http://yandex.ru/).  
The icons are from the [Ionic Framework](http://ionicons.com/), a 100% free and open source MIT Licensed icon font.
